   ```

4. **Comment on a Pull Request**  
   Instruct the agent to comment on a specific pull request.

   Example:

   ```
   Comment on PR #42: "Great work! Please address the minor formatting issues."
   ```

5. **Merge a Pull Request and Reward Contributor**  
   Ask the agent to merge a pull request and reward the contributor with **STRK** or **Lords** tokens.
